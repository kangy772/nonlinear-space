            <!-- PHASE 1: HISTORICAL FRAME -->
            <div class="phase phase-1" data-phase="1">
                <p>In his A History of the World War (page 212), Captain Liddell Hart reports that a planned offensive by thirteen British divisions, supported by fourteen hundred artillery pieces, against the German line at Serre-Montauban, scheduled for July 24, 1916, had to be postponed until the morning of the 29th. He comments that torrential rain caused this delay - which lacked any special significance. The following deposition, dictated by, read over, and then signed by Dr. Yu Tsun, former teacher of English at the Tsingtao Hochschule, casts unsuspected light upon this event. The first two pages are <span class="trigger-word" data-trigger="phase1-unlock">missing</span>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <!-- PHASE 2: THE DEPOSITION BEGINS -->
            <div class="phase phase-2" data-phase="2" style="opacity: 0;">
                <p>. . . and I hung up the phone.</p>
                
                <p>Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?</p>
                
                <p>I went up to my bedroom. Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door. I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back. The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky. It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death. In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?</p>
                
                <p>Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. Century follows century, and things happen only in the present. There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me . . . The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.</p>
                
                <p>In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre. A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs. If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany ...</p>
                
                <p>My voice, my human voice, was weak. How could it reach the ear of the Chief? The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire. A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us. I said aloud, "I must <span class="trigger-word phase2-trigger" data-trigger="phase2-flee">flee</span>."</p>

                <p>I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me. Something—perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself—made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find: a watch, a few coins, a notebook, a letter I decided to destroy at once (and did not destroy), and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly, I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely, I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</p>
                
                <p>In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information. He lived in a suburb less than half an hour away by train.</p>

                    <p>I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an end. I did not do it for Germany—no. Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.</p>
                    <p>I knew an Englishman—a modest man—who, for me, was as great as Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief feared those of my race. I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the Captain.</p>
                
                <p class="word-by-word">Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, and went out.</p>

                <p>The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages.</p>
                
                <p><span class="reveal-trigger a-man" id="aManTrigger">A man</span> I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform.</p>

                <p>Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window. From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate.</p>
                
                <p>The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied.</p>
                
                <p>One of them asked me: "Are you going to <span class="reveal-trigger dr-albert" id="drAlbertTrigger">Dr. Stephen Albert's house</span>?"</p>

                <p>The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths.</p>
                
                <p>Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of <span class="typewriter-trigger tsui-pen" id="tsuiPenTrigger">Ts'ui Pen</span>.</p>

                <p>I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.</p>
                
                <p>The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.</p>
                
                <p>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.</p>
                
                <p>"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the <span class="reveal-trigger garden-word" id="gardenTrigger">garden</span>?"</p>

                <p>The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, we went into a library filled with books from both East and West.</p>
